## **Summary**
The DEA is seeking to **permanently place** the following seven fentanyl-related substances into **Schedule I**, citing high potential for abuse and lack of accepted medical use in the U.S. These substances were initially controlled under a **temporary order** in 2018, which has been extended multiple times through congressional action.

6. **tetrahydrothiofuranyl fentanyl**
7. **para-Fluoro valeryl fentanyl**

### **Key Provisions of the Rule**

2. **Regulatory Oversight** – Applies existing **manufacturing, distribution, import/export, and possession restrictions**.
3. **Criminal and Civil Penalties** – Violations will carry Schedule I penalties.

5. **Comment Period** – Stakeholders, including medical professionals, law enforcement, and industry representatives, have until **January 30, 2025**, to submit comments.

## **Public Engagement**
