## Key Term
"Medical Devices"

## **Overview**
The FDA is proposing a rule to establish a unique device identification system to adequately identify medical devices through their distribution and use. The system will facilitate the traceability of devices and improve patient safety by providing a consistent way to identify devices and manage recalls. The rule will require the label of medical devices to include a unique device identifier (UDI) that can be used to track the device throughout its distribution and use. The rule will also require the submission of information about each device to a central database, which will be used to track the device's distribution and use. The rule will apply to all medical devices distributed in the United States, including devices that are manufactured in other countries and imported into the United States.
